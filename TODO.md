# To Do
- [X] convert healpix tensorflow operations to pytorch, confirmed to match tf version of `generate_healpix_grid`
- [X] fix in-place operation in `predict_probability` preventing gradient backward propagation
- [X] np arrays to cuda check
- [X] numpy vs torch speed test in `generate_healpix_grid`
- [X] add recorder, metrics, and plotting
- [ ] Add gradient ascent to `predict_rotation` using argmax(logits) as initialization
- [ ] Add positional encoding
- [X] train/eval mode in so3pdf
- [ ] `output_pdf` are these really normalized?
- [X] compare authors Euler angle -> so3 grid to more intuitive axis-angle -> so3; see Hopf coordinates
